      <p>My name is Marcin. I am 30 years old and I was born in Poland, in 1987, during the late years of communism. In the early 90s, I remember being very minimalistic and being taught by my parents to appreciate everything I had.</p>

      <p>I moved to America in August of 2001, a month before the 9/11 attacks on World Trade Center. Originally, I was only going to remain here for 3 years but I stayed an extra 12 years due to the fact that an American college degree looks great everywhere else in the world.</p>

      <p>I love music, especially heavy metal. My favoroite band is Rammstein, from Germany. I enjoy going to concerts and attempt to buy some merchandise from every concert I go to.</p>

      <p>I also like video games and my favorite is The Witcher 3, not just because it was made by a Polish studio.</p>

      <p>I like good beer and pizza.</p>
